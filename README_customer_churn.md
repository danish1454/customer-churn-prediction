## üìñ Project Overview

### 1. Introduction
Understanding the reasons why customers leave a service is crucial. This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict churn.

### 2. Loading Libraries & Data
We begin by importing necessary libraries and loading the CSV dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

### 3. Understanding Data
A preliminary look into column types, null values, and data structure.

### 4. Visualizing Missing Data
We use `seaborn` and `missingno` (optional) to identify any missing or null values.

### 5. Data Manipulation
Converting categorical values, encoding binary features, dealing with numerical conversions and outliers.

### 6. Data Visualization
Exploring distributions, churn correlations, and key feature importance with plots.

### 7. Data Preprocessing
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Train-test split

### 8. Model Building & Evaluation
We evaluate several models using confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and ROC curves:

#### üîç Logistic Regression
